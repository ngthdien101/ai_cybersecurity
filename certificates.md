It really depends on the individual's situation and ability. But let me tell you, both **Masters in cybersecurity** and **certification** do not guarantee you top jobs in the cybersecurity industry.

You should always focus on **SKILLS** which can help you grow in your career.

---

## When to Choose What?

- **Non-technical background?**  
  Go for a **Masters degree** (but from a good college).  
  A Master's degree offers:
  - Structured curriculum  
  - More time to learn  
  - In-depth curriculum  
  - Internship opportunities  

- **Working professional with some industry experience?**  
  Go for **certifications** – they will add some shine to your resume.

## The Real Focus: Skills for a Good Job

Broadly, there are **two dimensions** to any job interview:

1. **Level 1: Behavioral Skills**  
2. **Level 2: Technical Skill-set**

---

## Level 1: Behavioral Skills

- Behavioral interviewing is a research method showing that **past behavior predicts future behavior**.
- Candidates are expected to provide **examples** of how they solved specific problems in previous/current roles.
- Interviewers assess:
  - Decision-making under pressure  
  - Ability to deliver results  
  - Communication with subordinates, peers, and managers  

**Sample Behavioral Questions:**

- Describe a time you had a different opinion from colleagues.  
- Describe a situation when you disagreed with your manager. How did you handle it?  
- Why do you want to join us?  
- Describe one experience where you invented and simplified something.

## Level 2: Technical Skill-set

Before diving in, **identify the cybersecurity subdomain** you’re interested in.

### Possible Subdomains in Cybersecurity:

- Application Security  
- Network Security  
- Cloud Security  
- Malware Analysis  
- Incident Response  
- VAPT (Vulnerability and Penetration Testing)  
- SOC (Security Operation Center)  
- Compliance and Risk Management  

> _Note: This is not an exhaustive list._

### Core Topics Across All Domains:

- **Internet Basics**
  - Servers  
    - DNS / DHCP  
  - Internet Protocols  
  - HTML Basics  

- **Programming/Scripting**  
  > _Important: Many cybersecurity folks neglect programming, but it’s crucial for top-tier companies like Google._  
  - Python / C / C++ (or any language of your choice)  
  - Bash scripting  

- **Applied Cryptography**
  - Symmetric Cryptography  
  - Asymmetric Cryptography  

- **Basic Cybersecurity Terminologies**  
  - Attacks, Risks  
  - Confidentiality, Authenticity, Non-repudiation, Availability  
  - Risk Management  
  - Attack Vectors  
  - OWASP Top 10  
  - Penetration Testing  

- **Security Compliance and Governance**
